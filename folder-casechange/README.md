rename.py
===========

This program allows the quick renaming of files and folders to comply with specific naming conventions.  It changes said files and folders to lower case and replaces unecessary characters such as '&' and '_' with dashes (-).  It queries the user to whether to change just folders or to include files and whether it should include subdirectores.

1. Place the python file 'rename.py' in the folder that has the contents that you would wish to change to lower case.
2. Run the python program.
3. Answer the prompts.
