===========

This series of programs allows the quick renaming of files and folders (depending on the program) to comply with specific naming conventions.  It changes said files and folders to lower case and replaces unecessary characters such as '&' and '_' with dashes (-).

1. Place the python file in the folder that has the contents that you would wish to change to lower case.
	-	folder-lowercase: changes all folders in current directory
	-	subfolder-lowercase: changes all folders and subfolders in current directory
	-	file-lowercase: changes all files and folders in current directory
	-	subfile-lowercase: changes all files, folders, subfiles, and subfolders in current directory
2. Run the python program.
